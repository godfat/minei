= minei changes history

== minei 0.1.1 -- 2010-10-01

Reorganized build.xml and implementation.
Try if lazy val would be more efficient?

== minei 0.1.0 -- 2010-09-27

We're calculating the real possibility, that is counting
hitting combinations divided by all combinations:

  combos_hit.toDouble / combos

Which combos is calculated by:

  overlap_clue    .combos * exclusive_combos(overlap_clue) + combos

Note, this assumes all clues are overlapped together, or not overlapped
at all. It means it works fine on 2 clues, but for 3 clues, it's very
likely to calculate wrongly. Consider the case where A overlaps with B,
and B overlaps with C, but A *doesn't* overlap with C. This would only
work for cases like A overlaps with B and C, and that's the only place
which got overlapped.

combos_hit is calculated with the same manner:

  overlap_clue_hit.combos * exclusive_combos(overlap_clue) + combos

This has another problem. This assumes the hit pos is right inside the
overlapped area, but which could be false if we calculate more blocks.
This would be more trouble if we increase the search level of nearby
blocks, since the overlapping problem would be more likely encountered.



== minei 0.0.1 -- never

The possibility is in the simplest form, and which is a fake:

  amount.toDouble / poses.size

This didn't consider cases where clues got overlapped,
so the possibility would be greater than 1. (thus fake)
