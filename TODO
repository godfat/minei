= minei todo list

0. short-circuit it when 100% found. (reduce computing)

1. mark impossible blocks to 0 instead of unknown block.
   (tkcn) (reduce computing)

2. use better algorithm to split ClueSet instead of nearby
   (stimim) (more accurate comparing to calculate nearby 2)

3. use combinations of overlapped clues to calculate combos
   (real possibility)

4. do we consider the remaining mines? (tkcn) (more real possibility)

5. do we consider the possibility for opponent if minei failed to hit
   the mine? thus, we'll need to calculate the score for the input,
   so it will truly be a minimax algorithm. (stimim) (scoring)
