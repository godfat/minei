= minei todo list

(O) 0. mark impossible blocks to 0 instead of unknown block.
       (tkcn) (reduce computing)

(X) 1. short-circuit it when 100% found. (reduce computing)

(O) 2. use better algorithm to split ClueSet instead of nearby
       (stimim) (more accurate comparing to calculate nearby 2)

(O) 3. use combinations of overlapped clues to calculate combos
       (real probability)

(X) 4. do we consider the remaining mines? (tkcn) (more real probability)

(X) 5. do we consider the probability for opponent if minei failed to hit
       the mine? thus, we'll need to calculate the score for the input,
       so it will truly be a minimax algorithm. (stimim) (scoring)
